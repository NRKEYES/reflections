So, here all we learned was how to use diff and diff -u to compare two files.

Pretty handy to see what changed. A bit hard to read the output, though I am sure that could be mastered.

Just read a handy tip:
    Use short lines.
    Makes sense, a long ass line doesn't narrow the problem as much.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

    It is nice when you want to make big changes, but fear breaking something.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    You can miss stuff, but it be done intelligently.
